# TakeOutTheTrash.Api
.Net Core 5 Api 

Now that the TakeOutTheTrash-UI is becoming established I will start to develop this api and eventually an entity framework database to accompany it.

TO DO

// Add remaining controllers. // Create EF project. // Logging. // Error handling. // increase test coverage. // feature test with specflow once db is in a state of maturity.
